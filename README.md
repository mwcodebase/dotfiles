# Environment setup
Here are the standardized versions of my unix environment.
Each directory holds the environment for it's correcsponding OS type.
Enter the appropriate directory and run ./initial_{OS}_setup
The scripts obviously assume I have already installed and setup git.

Currently, only the WSL scripts are complete.
